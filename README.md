## ✉️ Quick Confession

I started AIVA because I was tired of setting up MCP and tired of AI companies harvesting our data.  
Someone had to build an alternative.

Learning as I go, powered by hope, coffee, and AI,  
I’ve somehow ended up with this messy code, and now I realize I need some help.

I'm also new to GitHub, so I’d appreciate any guidance or help on our Discord server: [**Join Discord**](https://discord.gg/PdwEDNxEts)
